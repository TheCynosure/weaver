Weaver weaves a spider tapestry of your favorite image.

Assuming you have the following installed:

    SDL2

    SDL2_image

Just do:

    make

And use it:

    ./weaver path/to/image.png threshold

Play with threshold (0-255) for weave intensity. Intense weaves take a long time.

Hit END to stop weaving early. END again to exit.
