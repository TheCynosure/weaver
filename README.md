Weaver weaves a spider tapestry of your favorite image.

*A Windows 10 release is available.*

Otherwise if you are on Unix, use your package manager to install the development packages for:

    SDL2

    SDL2_image

And then go:

    make; ./weaver path/to/image.png threshold

Play with threshold (0-255) for weave intensity. Intense weaves take a long time.
